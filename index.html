<dt> <a href="tig/index.html">Anthro 2001</a>: <b>Anthropology as a Major
and a Career</b> 
<dd> 
<p>
This course is designed to help you transition from student to
career. The best way to do that is to start now to identify career
opportunities of interest, so that you have time to obtain the skills
and experience that will help you achieve your goals. This course will
<ul>
<li> teach you about career opportunities for anthropology
majors 
<li> introduce you to University and Departmental opportunities and
resources 
<li> help you to identify your own goals and how to reach them, and
<li> teach you to be a more competitive applicant for internships,
jobs, and graduate school. 
</ul>

Anthro 4481/6481</A>: <b>Evolutionary Psychology</b>
<dd> 
<p>Evolutionary psychology is a new inter-disciplinary field that studies
how our preferences, emotions, and ways of thinking and behaving have
been shaped by natural selection.  In this course we will learn
how human nature has evolved to cope with problems of survival,
mating,  parenting, cooperation, and competition.</p>

Anthro 4169/5163</A>: <b>Ethnographic Methods</b>
<dd> 
<p>This course is designed to introduce students to methods for
collecting ethnographic data.  We  devote the first half of the
term to learning techniques of behavior observation and interviewing.
Systematic behavior observation and interviewing techniques will be
learned in the context of class projects.</p>

<p>During the remaining weeks of the term, students will work on fieldwork
projects of their own choice.  Class time during this period will be
devoted to (a) discussion about the progress and problems that
students are facing with their projects, and (b) lectures about other
fieldwork methods, the specific topics to depend on student interests.
There will be light reading assignments during the last part of the class,
and maybe a few exercises, depending on topics chosen.</p>
