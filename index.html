<dt> <a href="tig/index.html">Anthro 3001</a>: <b>Anthropology as a Major
and a Career</b> 
<dd> 
<p>
The course has two main aims: to give new anthropology majors the
information and skills needed to be a successful student in the
Department of Anthropology, and to prepare them to use their
anthropology degree productively after graduation.  Students will
learn from guest speakers about the different sub-disciplines of
anthropology and how to use them professionally, and about the
research and career advising opportunities offered by the University.

<b>Sex and Gender</b>
<dd> 
<p>Why are men masculine, women feminine, and sometimes vice versa?
In this course we use a bio-cultural perspective to understand
differences in the behavior of women and men.  We begin with the
biology of development and the hormonal bases of sex differences in
behavior.  We then consider how these physiological factors interact
with socialization pressures to produce differences between girls and
boys.  Next, we look at how evolution has shaped human patterns of
mating and parenting.  Mealey, a psychologist whose text we will read
in this section, focuses on cross-cultural similarities.  Yet the
anthropological literature documents considerable variation in mating
and parenting cross-culturally.  We will conclude the course, therefore,
by addressing this cross-cultural variation and trying to explain it.</p>

Anthro 4481/6481</A>: <b>Evolutionary Psychology</b>
<dd> 
<p>Evolutionary psychology is a new inter-disciplinary field that studies
how our preferences, emotions, and ways of thinking and behaving have
been shaped by natural selection.  In this course we will learn
how human nature has evolved to cope with problems of survival,
mating,  parenting, cooperation, and competition.</p>

Anthro 4169/5163</A>: <b>Ethnographic Methods</b>
<dd> 
<p>This course is designed to introduce students to methods for
collecting ethnographic data.  We will devote the first half of the
term to learning techniques of behavior observation and interviewing.
Systematic behavior observation and interviewing techniques will be
learned in the context of class projects..</p>

<p>During the remaining weeks of the term, students will work on fieldwork
projects of their own choice.  Class time during this period will be
devoted to (a) discussion about the progress and problems that
students are facing with their projects, and (b) lectures about other
fieldwork methods, the specific topics to depend on student interests.
There will be light reading assignments during the last part of the class,
and maybe a few exercises, depending on topics chosen.</p>
