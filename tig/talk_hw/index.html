<H2><CENTER>Extra-Credit (2pts) Talk to a Prof Assignment<CENTER></H2>


<h3>Background</h3>


One of the benefits of being at a research university is having
professors who are world-class researchers. One of the drawbacks is 
large classes and a feeling of anonymity and intimidation that makes
students uncomfortable talking to these profs.
<p>

Yet nothing warms the prof's heart as much as a student who is
interested in the course material and wants to discuss it.  In order
to get more from your education, and because getting to know these
profs may lead to other good things, such as a more personalized
letter of recommendation, this assignment is to have a substantive
talk with one of your current or previous anthropology professors.

<h3>Assignment</h3>
</p>
<p>


<font color=darkred>
Go to one of your anthropology professors and have a SUBSTANTIVE
conversation </font> about the course material.  For example: ask a
question about an argument or claim that was unclear or that you
disagree with, tell the prof about an idea that occurred to you as you
read the material, discuss how a concept applies to other evidence you
know about, etc.
</p>
<p>
<font color=darkred>
Common topics of discussion that would NOT count as
substantive </font> for the purposes of this extra-credit assignment
are (a) procedural questions, such as questions about the course
requirements, exams, the form an assignment should take, etc, (b)
questions about how you are doing in the course, and (c)
getting-to-know-you questions, such as "how did you get interested in
anthropology?"  These are useful things to talk about, but the purpose
of this assignment is to have an intellectual exchange about ideas and
the evidence for ideas.  Those kinds of discussions require more
initiative from you, but they will enhance your education and will
impress your professor.

</p>
<p>

<font color=darkred>
Write a short paragraph </font> summarizing the discussion and
submit to turnitin.com.  Please include only enough detail so that it is
obvious you had the discussion and that it was "substantive" as defined above.
Due date is on the homepage and syllabus, but earlier will be more useful for you.
