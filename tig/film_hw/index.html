<H2><CENTER>Film Review Assignment<CENTER></H2>

<ol>
<li> <strong> Watch</strong> the film <em><font color=darkred>
Real People, Real Careers.  </font>  </em>
It is a 47 minute film consisting of interviews with anthropologists
in a variety careers, at least some of which are likely to surprise
you. 
 <p>
<font color=darkred>
The url to stream the video is on the turnitin calendar for March 10. 
<p>
</font>  
Sorry about the inonvenience of the extra link.  I can't put the url
here because this is a public website and the video is available only
to this class.  
You can also view the DVD at the library knowledge commons; the call number is GN 41.8 .A59 2006.

<li> <strong>Write</strong> a brief essay (about 250 words)
describing two or more of the careers discussed in the
film, focusing on those of greatest interest to you.
<p>
The point of the written assignment is to make it obvious to me that
you watched the film, so <strong>include enough specifics</strong> to accomplish that.
In other words, for the careers you describe,  include in your
discussion a description of what the anthropologist 
in the film is doing, not just a review of the field they are working in.  
<p>
Submit to turnitin.
