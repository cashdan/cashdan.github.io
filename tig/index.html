<h1>Anthro 2001: Anthropology as a Major and a Career
</h1>
This course is designed to help you transition from student to
career. The best way to do that is to start now to identify career
opportunities of interest, so that you have time to obtain the skills
and experience that will help you achieve your goals. This course will
<ul>
<li> teach you about career opportunities for anthropology
majors 
<li> introduce you to University and Departmental opportunities and
resources 
<li> help you to identify your own goals and how to reach them, and
<li> teach you to be a more competitive applicant for internships,
jobs, and graduate school. 
</ul>
