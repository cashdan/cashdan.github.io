<H1>Individual and Group Reports</H1>

The final assignment is designed to get you to think about how you want
to use your anthropology degree.  It is in two parts:
<ul>
<li>An oral group presentation on your area of interest
<li>An individual written report on two possible employers, internships, or
post-graduate educational institutions.
</ul>

Don't worry if you have no idea what you might do with your
anthropology degree after you graduate; this is an opportunity to
learn about options.  The homepage has many links and articles about
career resources, so this is a good place to start.

-->

<H2>Oral Presentations</H2>

In order that students can learn from each other, you will give a
brief group presentation to the class.  There will be class time for
you to meet with your group, compare notes, learn from each other, and
decide how to present what you have learned to the rest of the class,
but you will also need to consult (in person or virtually) outside of class
to put the presentation together.
<p>

<em>The oral presentations should introduce the audience to careers
within the area you are researching</em>.
It should tell people about opportunities in that area, requirements
for entry, advantages and disadvantages, etc.  Specifics about
particular institutions are only relevant to the extent that they 
illuminate these broader issues.
<p>
Divide up topics among the group members so that you can give an
integrated presentation, and prepare a powerpoint (or equivalent)
slideshow to accompany your oral presentation.  
<p>
It is challenging for a professor to accurately assess performance
and participation in group projects, so your grade will be based, in
part, on peer evaluations.  Those are the "peer reviews" mentioned on
the syllabus.

<H2>Individual Written Report</H2>

The individual written report will be about 1000 words. You will describe
two possible employers, internships, or post-graduate educational institutions. 
<p>
<a href="finalreports.pdf">This document</a> gives instructions for
writing the report.  Before you can write it, though, you need to
figure out what to write.  The steps below will guide you in this
process.
<p>

<h4>1. Finding Schools, Internships, or Employers</h4>
<!--
<IMG SRC="anthro_cannibals.gif" align="right" width=300>


The first step is to find an institution (school, internship, etc.) to
research.  Before you begin, take a look at at least one of the
following:
<ul>
<p>

<li><a href="finding_grad_schools.pdf">tip sheet for finding grad
schools</a>, both anthropological and professional.  
</p>

<p>
<li>Internship materials at the career center and online, for example
<a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/plan/high-school/8382.html"
>How to Find an Internship (college board)</a> and 
<a href="http://internships.about.com/od/internsites/tp/howtofind.htm"
>Finding an internship (about.com)</a>.   
The Society for Applied Anthropology has prepared a 
<a href="Appliedanthropology.pdf">brochure</a>
specifically about internships for anthropology students interested in
environmental issues.  There is also a book of internships in my box in the anthro library.
<p>
<li> <a href="http://www.stpt.usf.edu/coas/anthropology/CareersinAnthropology.htm"

>this website on anthropological career options </a> if you are
researching careers in public or private organizations or businesses.  The career
and article links on the homepage will also give you ideas.
</p>

</ul>

<h4>2. Researching the School, Internship, or Employer</h4>

After you have found a school or organization that looks likely,
review the following tip sheets that describe things to look for and
think about.  If you find out that the school or institution isn't as
appropriate as you initially thought, just explain why in your written
report;  you do not need to look for another school or organization.
<ul>
<p>
<li><a href="presentations_grad_school.pdf">Tip sheet for researching a
graduate school</a>.  
 Some items are less relevant for professional schools (law, medicine,
business etc) than for academic departments such as anthropology, so use as
appropriate.

<li><a href="presentations_internships.pdf">Tip sheet for researching 
internships</a>
</p>
<p>
<li><a href="presentations_jobs.pdf">Tip sheet for researching employers
</a>
</ul>
<h4>3. Writing the Report</h4>

<a href="finalreports.pdf">This document</a> gives instructions for
writing the report.  Submit to turnitin.com on the date specified in the
syllabus.
