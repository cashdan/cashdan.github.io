<H2>Oral Presentations</H2>

In order that students can learn from each other, you will give a
brief group presentation (slideshow) to the class.  There will be class time for
you to meet with your group, compare notes, learn from each other, and
decide how to present what you have learned to the rest of the class,
but you will also need to consult (in person or virtually) outside of class
to put the presentation together.
<p>

<em>The oral presentations should introduce the audience to careers
within the area you are researching</em>.
It should tell people about opportunities in that area, requirements
for entry, advantages and disadvantages, etc.  Specifics about
particular institutions are only relevant to the extent that they 
illuminate these broader issues.
<p>
Divide up topics among the group members so that you can give an
integrated presentation, and prepare a powerpoint (or equivalent)
slideshow to accompany your oral presentation.  Please save the slideshow
as a pdf on your local computer and send me a copy.  

<H2>Peer Reviews</H2>
<p>
It is challenging for a professor to accurately assess performance
and participation in group projects, so your grade will be based, in
part, on peer evaluations.  Those are the "peer reviews" mentioned on
the syllabus.
</p>
The grade should be based primarily on whether they were active and helpful participants in the group, and secondarily on the quality of the work that went into the presentation.  

Please give a letter grade to everyone in your group, and  if someone did unusually well or poorly, explain what they did well, or what they failed to do.
