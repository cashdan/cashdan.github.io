<h2>Background (Read this before doing the assignment!)</h2>
<p>

You've learned a lot about the library's resources, and about
databases that help you find information.  The purpose of this
assignment is to encourage you to use them.
For most term papers, you will need to find relevant <b>primary</b>
literature, and most primary literature consists of articles in
professional journals.  These databases can help you find them.

<h3>Publicly-available databases</h3>

Some useful databases are publicly available: two of the best are
<a href="http://www.scholar.google.com">www.scholar.google.com</a>
(for all the professional literature)
and <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">www.pubmed.gov</a> (for
health-related topics).  Once you find an article on these sites,
there will be links to more recent articles that have cited them.

<p>
<strong> Get it at UofU: </strong>
Google scholar is excellent right out of the box, but there are ways
to tweak it to make it even more useful.  Do the following to get the full-text
source from Marriott, even when it doesn't show up on google scholar:
<ol>
<li> click "settings" on the google scholar homepage
<li> click "library links" (at the far left) 
<li> type "university of utah" (or "utah") in the box and click the button
<li> in the menu that comes up, click the "get it at UofU" box and
  click save
</ol>
Google scholar with then show "get it at UofU" for most articles. Click on that, sign in with your unid, and you will see the article link without further searching.

<h3>Databases available through Marriott</h3>

Other databases are available only through Marriott Library.  One good
general database is <strong>Academic Search Premier</strong>.  Another
is <strong>Scopus</strong>, which will pick up recent material across
the sciences.  Some great databases are specific to particular
disciplines, like
<strong>Psycinfo</strong> (for psychology articles) and <strong>Biosis</strong> (for
biology articles).  There is no equivalent in anthropology, unfortunately.  
<strong>Anthrosource</strong> is limited;  it picks up articles published by the American
Anthropological Association (AAA), but the most highly cited
anthropology journals are not published by the AAA, so are missed by
Anthrosource.
<p>
The <strong>eHRAF</strong> is a wonderful anthropological database of
a different sort.  It contains paragraphs from ethnographies (books
describing particular societies), searchable by society and topic.
You don't use it to find references, as you do with the other
databases.  You use it to get the full text from ethnographies.  Use
it if you want to do a cross-cultural study of a particular topic
(search by topic) or an in-depth study of a particular society (search
by the society name).  It is challenging to use effectively, so email
me for tips if you are interested in using it.


<h2>Assignment</h2>

Pick a topic and use <font color=darkred> THREE  DIFFERENT</font>
databases to find three articles relevant to the topic.  
<p>
One must
be <font color=darkred>Google Scholar</font> (be sure to adjust the settings to
"get it at UofU" -- see above).  
One must be 
<font color=darkred>Academic Search Premier</font>, available through
Marriott.
The third database can be either pubmed or one of the other
Marriott databases (but NOT the main Marriott searchbar).
<p>
For at least one of the Marriott database searches, use a sensible
<font color=darkred>
truncation 
</font>
in one of the search terms.  The typical use of truncation is, as the word indicates, to truncate (shorten) a word stem and add a "wildcard" to 
broaden the search;  for example anthrop* broadens the search by giving you anthropology, anthropological, etc.

<p>
1. For each of the three articles, write down the following:
<ol>
<li> the name of the database you found it in 

<li> the keyword search you used to find it

<IMG SRC="library.jpeg" align="right" width=160/>
<li> the full article reference (title, author, date, journal name, volume, and pages)
</ol>
2. List a few other words your truncation example would pick up.  

<p>
3. In a couple of sentences (more is ok, but not necessary), tell me
which database you found most useful, and why.
