<h1> Oral History Exercise </h1> 

COVID safety issues will complicate this assignment, both in finding people to interview, and in conducting it safely.  Unless you are in a COVID-safe pod
with the person you plan to interview, or can do this outdoors at a safe distance, you will need to do these online.
<p>
You may reach out to a relative, friend or acquaintance, but choose someone whose history you are not familiar with.  Interviewing older people is a wonderful way to get insight into the past, and that should be your first choice.  Your grandmother or uncle, or perhaps an older neighbor, will almost certainly be happy to talk to you.   You will do two interviews.  
<p>
If you have trouble finding people to interview, or if you would find it more useful to do in-depth interviews on another topic, send me an email and we'll discuss options.
<p>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li> Have a topic or theme in mind, and write down some open-ended questions before you begin.
<p>
<li> When you contact them to request the interview, explain what you want to ask them about, and that it is for a class exercise.  Ask for permission to record and take notes. Explain that their responses will remain confidential and their identity anonymous.  
<p>
<li> You control the subject matter, but be flexible enough to respond to their answers and be ready to
move in unexpected but potentially informative directions.
<p>
<li> The aim is to move the speaker back in time -â€“ to reconstruct or re-create the experience. To avoid a present bias, try asking them to describe what a place or event looked/smelled/sounded like.  
  <p>
<li> Your opening question should invite a reasonably expansive answer.  However, not everyone is a born storyteller, so you may need to ask more specific questions to get them going.
<p>
<li> If they say something that is inconsistent, or contradicts something else you have heard, follow up. <p>
<li> Normally, you would transcribe the interview as soon as possible.  However, transcribing an audiotape is time-consuming, and you don't need to do that for this exercise.  But do review and edit your notes while the interview is fresh in your mind.
