<h1> Systematic Behavior Observation Exercise </h1> 

This study will examine COVID-related behavior in outdoor public
spaces (e.g., people as they enter or leave public establishments).
Stay a safe distance from the people you observe.  The details of this
assignment will be worked out collectively, based on your informal
observations, and the hypotheses and variables the class decides to
address.  This page will be updated accordingly.  Plan on doing an
hour of observation total (it need not be continuous).
<p>
 The week following the observation itself, there are two assignments:
<ol>
<li>  Code the data, in the format we decide on in class, and enter the data on a shared google doc.
<li>   Critique the observation exercise.
</ol>
<h2> Coding the data </h2>

Code the data you collected last week using the code (data dictionary) we developed in
class (this page will be updated with a link to our code).
Enter the data directly on the google spreadsheet. You will
receive an email invitation (let me know if you can’t access
it).
<p>
  Each row on the spreadsheet is an observation, and each column is a variable.  The
column labels correspond to the boldfaced short variable name on our code (data dictionary).
<p>
“Missing values” are when you don’t have the information for some
reason. Indicate missing values with a period (.) rather than a blank
space or NA (this is arbitrary, but convenient for me). Remember that zero
is a number, so should never be used to indicate missing values.  
<p>
You will probably find some problems with this
code—behavior that is hard to categorize, categories that are
not mutually-exclusive, etc. But it should be serviceable. Do your best and email if
you have questions.
</ol>

<h2> Critique our observational study </h2>

We can regard this as a pilot, and so should expect some problems.  
Submit a brief critique of our study (max 500 words). What did we do right/wrong? How might it be
done better?
