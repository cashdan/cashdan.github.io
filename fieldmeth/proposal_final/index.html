<H2><CENTER>Research Proposal, Part 2 <CENTER></H2>



In this section of the proposal, provide a detailed statement of the
methods you will use.  Focus on methods of data collection rather than
methods of data analysis (you don't need to say anything about methods
of analysis for this project).
<p>
In contrast to sections 1 and 2, I want lots of detail here.  Be specific.

<H4>What to include</H4> 

<ul>
<li> The population you will be studying (who, about how many) 
<li> Sampling strategy (since this is a toy study, indicate what would be ideal and also what you actually plan to do).
<li> What specific methods you will use.  If you are interviewing,
what will you ask?  If you are observing, how will you sample and
record?  Etc.  
<li> Make it clear how the data you collect will allow you to answer your research question.
</ul>

<H4>Important Notes</H4>

<ul>
<li>You are not bound to this proposal.  If you learn something later that
you want to try, go ahead.  Talk to me about it, but feel free to do
it.
<li>It will be helpful if you can begin with some informal data
  collection (observation, interviewing, participant observation)
  before you complete this section, so that you know it will be feasible.
</ul>


<H4>How many people should you interview or observe?</H4>

<ul>
<li><strong>For the final project: </strong>Since this is a class exercise,  enough to show me that you have put in a good effort (so, 
more for a self-administered survey than an
intensive interview).  In most cases, you will not have a large enough
sample to draw conclusions, but you will have enough preliminary data
to help you design a real study.
<p>
<li><strong>For real research: </strong> The broader question of "how many
participants" you need in order to feel confident in your conclusions
is important, and it has an answer.  For an introduction to the topic see
the first links (from "Statistics Done Wrong" by Alex
  Reinhart)  and Cohen's "power primer".  Statistical programs now have
procedures for power calculations.
