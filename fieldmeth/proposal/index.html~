<H2><CENTER>Research Proposal, Part 1<CENTER></H2>

It is a great help to write a proposal (even if you don't need any
money), because it forces you to think clearly about what you are
going to do.  You will do the proposal over two weeks, and this page
describes the first part.  There is a link on the homepage to sample proposals.

<H3>Step 1: Finding a good topic</H3>

Your project must be designed around a research QUESTION.  Research
questions are most useful and interesting if they are derived from (or
can be related to) a body of theory.  This makes the results
generalizable, hence of interest to a wider range of researchers, and
potentially predictive of what might be found in different
populations.  Most empirical scientific research will also pose one or
more specific hypotheses.   
<p>
I would prefer that you work on something that you are genuinely
interested in or that you will find useful.  This could mean that you
are testing out methods you will use later in a different population
for thesis work.  It could mean that you are looking at something new
that, if it turns out well, you can work on next semester and turn
into a UROP project or a publishable paper.  Or it could be more
exploratory, but still relevant to your career goals somehow.  The
only requirement is that it shouldn't be a waste of your time.  Send
me an email if you want to discuss any of this.

<H3>Step 2:  Introduction</H3> 

<font color=darkred>
The first part of a proposal is the introduction.  
Write a paragraph
describing your research question, and how this project fits into it.
Include hypotheses if you have them.

<H3>Step 3: Background</H3>
The next part of a proposal is usual called "background" or
"background and significance."  This requires a literature search, so let's discuss that first.

<H4>3a: Doing the literature search</H4>

<font color=darkred>
Use at least two different electronic databases to research your
topic, find three to five usable references, and read (or skim) them 
If this topic is old news to you and you are very familiar
with the literature, try to find some new sources.  Pay attention to
the methods used, because you may want to model your study on them.
Use the guidance below if you are not familiar
with how to use electronic databases. </font color=darkred>
<p>
The two most useful publicly-available databases are 
<a href="http://www.scholar.google.com">www.scholar.google.com</a> for
everything, and medline, available publicly
as <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">www.pubmed.gov</a>, for anything
biomedical.
Other databases are available by going to the
Marriott library homepage and clicking
on the "Research Databases" tab on the top (also on the left-hand side).
Academic Search Premier is a good and very broad database.  
Click on "off-campus access" (blue bar
at the top) to access databases and more from home.
<p>
Google
Scholar, Pubmed, and Scopus (available through Marriott) differ from
many other databases because they allow you to see which articles have
cited the article you are looking at.  This type of forward search is
hugely valuable in getting you current on the literature.  They are
also very broad in coverage.  

<H4>3b: Writing the background section</H4> You will use the results of
your literature search to write the next part of your proposal.  The
aim of the background section is to show how the proposed research
fits into existing knowledge and how it will answer questions that
have arisen from earlier work.  It should be tailored to your research
question.  it is not a general tutorial on the topic.
<p>
<font color=darkred>
Write up the background section as described above.  This is a 
preliminary project and I am not expecting anything grand or
in depth.  Make it short (maximum one page).
