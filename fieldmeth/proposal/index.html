<H2><CENTER>Research Proposal, Part 1<CENTER></H2>

It is a great help to write a proposal (even if you don't need any
money), because it forces you to think clearly about what you are
going to do.  You will do the proposal over two weeks, and this page
describes the first part.  There is a link on the homepage to sample
proposals.  Your final project will be based on the research proposal
plus a "results" section.

<H3>Step 1: Finding a good topic</H3>

Your project must be designed around a research QUESTION.
<p>
Research questions are most scientifically useful and interesting if
they are derived from (or can be related to) a body of theory.  This
makes the results generalizable, hence of interest to a wider range of
researchers, and potentially predictive of what might be found in
different populations.  However, this is a learning exercise, so that
is not required for this assignment.
<p>
I would prefer that you work on something that you are genuinely
interested in or that you will find useful.  This could mean that you
are testing out methods you will use later in a different population
for thesis work.  It could mean that you are looking at something new
that, if it turns out well, you can work on next semester and turn
into a UROP project or a publishable paper.  Or it could be more
exploratory, but still relevant to your career goals somehow.  The
only requirement is that it shouldn't be a waste of your time.

  Send me an email to confirm (and help you narrow down) your topic.

  If you're stuck, consider the following:
<ul>
<li> Have you ever wondered (a) "why do some people do that?" or 
(b) "is this [experience/activity/etc] associated with [better/different] outcomes"? 
<li> Is there an article you've read recently, or something you've learned
  in class, that you found really interesting?  What were they trying to find
  out?  Could you explore something similar?
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Step 2:  Introduction</H3> 

The first part of a proposal is the introduction.  Write a paragraph
describing your research question, and in very general terms, how this project will
address it.  Include hypotheses if you have them.  For this project, keep it
brief, a paragraph is enough.
<p>
This is a learning project, and you don't have the burden of producing
new knowledge.  However, FYI, a good way to write an introduction for
a proposal to a scientific agency like NSF is to begin with a sentence
on the general topic, then a sentence or two each on what is
known, what we still don't know (might begin with "yet" or "however"),
how the proposed work will fill that gap in knowledge, and why it
matters.  The rest of the proposal then expands on that.

<H3>Step 3: Background</H3>
The next part of a proposal is usually called "background" or
"background and significance."  Its purpose is to show how your
project fits into existing literature on the subject.  It may
also be used to show that the project is feasible.

This requires a literature search, so let's discuss that first.

<H4>3a: Doing the literature search</H4>

<font color=darkred>
Use at least one electronic database to research your
topic, find three to five usable references, and read (or skim) them.
</font color=darkred>
If this topic is old news to you and you are very familiar
with the literature, try to find some new sources.  Pay attention to
the methods used, because you may want to model your study on them.
<p>
The  most useful publicly-available database, in my opinion, is
<a href="https://scholar.google.com">www.scholar.google.com</a>.
For health-related topics,  medline, available publicly
as <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">www.pubmed.gov</a>, is also useful.
Other databases are available by going to the
Marriott library homepage and clicking "research" at the top, and then
"databases".   
<p>
  When you search in google scholar you will find that many articles
  are not full-text.  However, you can get the full text from
  Marriott.  The easiest way to do that from home, so that you don't
  need to search for it on Marriott's site, is to tweak the google
  scholar setting options.  Go to the settings option (under the 3
  horizontal bars at the top left).  Then click "library links" on the
  left. Enter "Utah" (or university of utah) in the search bar, then
  click "University of Utah - Get It @ UU".  Now, when you search, you
  will see a direct link to the article (you will still have to sign
  on with your unid, but you won't have to search Marriott for the
  article).
    
<H4>3b: Writing the background section</H4> You will use the results of
your literature search to write the next part of your proposal.  The
aim of the background section is to show how the proposed research
fits into existing knowledge and how it will answer questions that
have arisen from earlier work.  It should be tailored to your research
question.  it is not a general tutorial on the topic.
<p>

Write up the background section as described above.  This is a 
preliminary project and I am not expecting anything grand or
in depth.  Make it short (maximum one page).
