<h1>Anthro 5169: Ethnographic Methods</h1>
</CENTER>

This course will introduce you to methods of ethnographic data
collection. Although ethnography involves both qualitative and
quantitative methods, and we will discuss both, the emphasis
will be on quantitative methods and scientific approaches.
<p>
We will begin with an introduction to research design, and will
then devote the first half of the term to learning techniques of behavior
observation and interviewing through class projects.
<p>
Because of the pandemic, observation techniques will be learned this
term by observing people at a safe distance in public spaces. There
will be two interviewing projects: (1) an oral history interview
exercise and (2) a class exercise in semi-structured and structured
interviewing and questionnaire design.
<p>
During the second half of the term, students will work on a fieldwork
project of their own choice. Assignments will be minimal during the
last few weeks of the term, to allow time for students to work on the
individual research projects. Class time during this period will be
devoted to discussion about student projects, practical fieldwork
issues, and lectures on other fieldwork techniques, the choice
depending on student interests.

<h2>Announcements (Oct 20)</h2>
</font color=darkred>
Bernard has posted a
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/bcs/anthro/samples/bernprop.jsp">
sample NSF proposal </a> that you might find helpful.  
The proposal proper begins below the first summary section (required
by NSF) and starts with the subhead "Statement of the Problem."
<p>
Read the first paragraph under that subhead (beginning with the words
"Reports on the state of...")  and you will see that it does all the
things I suggested for the opening of a proposal:

<ol>
 <li> introduces the general topic
 <li>  explains what is known
 <li> identifies the gap in our knowledge 
 <li> states how this proposal will fill that gap and
<li>  makes it clear why anyone should care (this can be anywhere in
 the paragraph)
</ol>
The rest of the introduction expands on this.  The Literature Review
section shows how the proposal fits into and builds on existing
literature.
<p>
Different grantiing agencies will have different specific guidelines,
which you should follow to the letter, but the general form is similar
across proposals.   
<p>  
Proposals are written by people in government, non-governmental
agencies, and businesses, not just academia, so learning how to write
them is a useful skill.   And of course students will need to write a
proposal if they want UROP funding for their undergraduate research.
