<h1>Anthro 5169: Ethnographic Methods</h1>
</CENTER>

This course will introduce you to methods of ethnographic data
collection. Although ethnography involves both qualitative and
quantitative methods, and we will discuss both, the emphasis
will be on quantitative methods and scientific approaches.
<p>
We will begin with an introduction to research design, and will
then devote the first half of the term to learning techniques of behavior
observation and interviewing through class projects.
<p>
Because of the pandemic, observation techniques will be learned this
term by observing people at a safe distance in public spaces. There
will be two interviewing projects: (1) an oral history interview
exercise and (2) a class exercise in semi-structured and structured
interviewing and questionnaire design.
<p>
During the second half of the term, students will work on a fieldwork
project of their own choice. Assignments will be minimal during the
last few weeks of the term, to allow time for students to work on the
individual research projects. Class time during this period will be
devoted to discussion about student projects, practical fieldwork
issues, and lectures on other fieldwork techniques, the choice
depending on student interests.

<h2>Announcements (Nov 10)</h2>

I have added a pdf to "Can you ask it" under the "Resources" section
below.  The first four pages illustrate, with some humor, why a researcher's
questions often make no sense to people in other cultures.

<p>
  From Last week:
<p>  
  Here is the
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/bcs/anthro/samples/bernprop.jsp">
  sample NSF proposal </a>
that I mentioned in class, should you want to take a look. 
<p>
  Please review the guidance for
<a href="proposal_final/index.html">
part 2 of the research proposal (methods) </a>  before doing
this week's assignment.  Chapter 7 in the text, assigned for next
week, may also be helpful,  so take a look now if you have time.
<p>
Different grantiing agencies will have different specific guidelines,
which you should follow to the letter, but the general form is similar
across proposals.   
<p>  
Proposals are written by people in government, non-governmental
agencies, and businesses, not just academia, so learning how to write
them is a useful skill.   And of course students will need to write a
proposal if they want UROP funding for their undergraduate research.
