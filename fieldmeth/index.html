<h1>Anthro 5169: Ethnographic Methods</h1>
</CENTER>

This course will introduce you to methods of ethnographic data
collection. The course will emphasize quantitative methods, and
scientific approaches within anthropology.
<p>

We will begin with an introduction to research design, and will then
devote the first half of the term to learning techniques of behavior
observation and interviewing. Because of the pandemic, observation
techniques will be learned this term by observing people at a safe
distance in public spaces, and interviewing will be done
online. There will be two interviewing projects: (1) an oral history
interview exercise and (2) a class exercise in semi-structured and
structured interviewing.  During the remaining weeks of the term,
students will work on a fieldwork project of their own
choice. Assignments will be minimal during the last few weeks of the
term, to allow time for students to work on the individual research
projects. Class time during this period will be devoted to discussion
about student projects, practical fieldwork issues, and lectures on
other fieldwork techniques, the choice depending on student
interests.
