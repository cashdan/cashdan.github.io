This is a three-part assignment:  first you will write some interview questions for our project, and upload them to a shared google doc Canvas.  Then you will read the questions others submitted, and submit a critique.  We will discuss the comments (anonymously) in class.  Finally, you will revise your questions as appropriate, and submit the final comments to Canvas.
<p>
The grade will be based on your critiques and final set of questions
<ul>
<li>Part 1: Question construction  (submit your questions to our shared google doc before 8am, Saturday)
<li>Part 2: Question critique  (submit to Canvas by noon, Monday)
<li>Part 3: Question revision  (submit to Canvas by Friday)
</ul>

<h2>Question Construction</h2>
</CENTER>

The topic will depend on class interests.  Include a mix of closed and
open questions, five or six is enough.

<CENTER>
<h2>Question Critiques</h2>
</CENTER>

Critique the questions from other students in the class.  After doing this, you may wish to critique your own also, which is fine too.  Don't comment on every question, only some that you think could be improved, or those you want to single out for commendation.  
<p>
Make the suggestions constructive, say what could be improved, and
<strong>improve (re-write) them</strong>.  
<p> Things to look for: response biases, leading questions,
double-barreled questions, order effects, recall issues, inappropiate
or inadequate items options, and lack of clarity
<p>
Upload the critiques to Canvas by Sunday evening.  

<CENTER>
<h2>Question Revision</h2>
</CENTER>
Revise your initial questions if you think the suggestions have improved them.  Submit to Canvas.
