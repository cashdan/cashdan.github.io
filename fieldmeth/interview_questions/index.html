<h2>Writing questions for structured interviews and questionnaires</h2>

It is often easier to see problems in someone else's work than in our own.  For that reason, this section will have a peer-review component.  There are threee parts:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Part 1: Question construction. You will write some interview questions on a common topic, to be decided in class, and upload the questions to a shared google doc.  Due by end of day Friday 10-16.
<p>
  <li>Part 2: Question critique: Read your classmates' questions, and if you see a question that could be improved, indicate why and try to re-write it.  You will submit the suggestions to me on a google doc, so that I can send them (anonymously) back to the authors.  Due Monday noon 10-19.
<p>
  <li>Part 3: Question revision: Use the critiques and class discussion to improve your questions. Submit to Canvas by Oct. 27.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Read the detailed instructions below.</strong>

<h4>Part 1: Question Construction</h4>

Read Bernard ch. 9 (questionnaires) and 11 (scaling) if you havenâ€™t done so.
<p>
The topic will depend on class interests.  Construct a questionnaire
or structured interview with 6 to 8 questions, including both closed and
open questions.  Use the tips given in lecture and
in <a href="designing_surveys.doc"> this document </a> for guidance.
<p>
Keep questions simple, and say them aloud to make sure that they will be easy to use.
Imagine that you are actually going to ask people these questions.  If it feels awkward, revise.
<p>
Make sure they are appropriate for adults of different ages and circumstances. 
<p>
Other things to watch for: response biases, leading questions, double-barreled questions, order effects, recall issues, inappropiate or inadequate items options, and lack of clarity. 


<h4>Part 2: Question Critiques</h4>

If you see a question that you think could be improved, write the name of the author, the question as written, an explanation of the problem, and a re-write.  Don't comment on every question, only some that you think could be improved.  Compile your suggestions and submit to me via Canvas by noon Monday (Oct 19).

<h4>Part 3: Question Revision</h4>

Revise your initial questions if you think the suggestions will improve them.  Submit to  Canvas by Oct 27 or before.
