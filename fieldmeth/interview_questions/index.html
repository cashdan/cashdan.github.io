<h2>Writing questions for structured interviews and questionnaires</h2>

It is often easier to see problems in someone else's work than in our own.  For that reason, this section will have a peer-review component.  There are threee parts:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Part 1: Question construction. You will write some interview
  questions on a common topic, to be decided in class, and upload the
  questions to Canvas (this part is not graded).  Due by end of day Friday 10-16.
<p>
  <li>Part 2: Question peer review:   Read your classmates' questions,
  and if you see a question that could be improved, indicate on their
  document why and try to re-write it. Due Monday noon 10-19.
<p>
  <li>Part 3: Question revision: Use the critiques and class
  discussion to improve your questions.  Submit to Canvas by 10-27.
  The grade will be based on your peer review comments and revised questions.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Read the detailed instructions below.</strong>

<h4>Part 1: Question Construction</h4>

Read Bernard ch. 9 (questionnaires) and 11 (scaling) if you havenâ€™t done so.
<p>
The topic will depend on class interests.  Construct a questionnaire
or structured interview with 6 to 8 questions, including both closed and
open questions.  Use the tips given in lecture and
in <a href="designing_surveys.doc"> this document </a> for guidance.
<p>
Keep questions simple, and say them aloud to make sure that they will be easy to use.
Imagine that you are actually going to ask people these questions.  If it feels awkward, revise.
<p>
Make sure they are appropriate for adults of different ages and circumstances. 
<p>
Other things to watch for: response biases, leading questions, double-barreled questions, order effects, recall issues, inappropiate or inadequate items options, and lack of clarity. 


<h4>Part 2: Question Critiques</h4>

If you see a question that you think could be improved, explain the
problem, and suggest a re-write.  Don't comment on every question, only
some that you think could be improved. Feel free to say positive
things about questions you like also.  Submit to Canvas by noon Monday (Oct 19).

<h4>Part 3: Question Revision</h4>

Revise your initial questions if you think the suggestions will
improve them.  If you disagree with the peer-review suggestions, feel
free to keep your question as originally written.  Submit to  Canvas
by Oct 27.
